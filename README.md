Upon completion, we will pay $250 in bitcoin to the contributor(s) of this repo.

The plugin is to be used as a payment module in the Tunga community which is currently being build using Buddypress (http://tunga.io/wordpress). But ideally it is developed in a generic way so that it can be used for any Wordpress/Buddypress website.

Much of the required functionality is already available from the Chrome- and Q2A plugins, which can be found at the following locations:
https://github.com/mobbr/mobbr-plugin-chrome
You can see the Chrome plugin in action by installing it from the Google Chrome store and then go to a webpage which has Mobbr support such as Github.com or Stackoverflow.com, e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9234830/how-to-hide-a-option-in-a-select-menu-with-css or https://github.com/mobbr/mobbr-frontend/issues/308
By clicking on the Mobbr icon the Mobbr payment lightbox appears.

You can see the Q2A plugin in action here: https://github.com/mobbr/mobbr-q2a-plugin 
and here: http://www.fastmovingtargets.nl/workforce/295/voor-soort-beginnende-ondernemingen-passen-beste-startups
It's in Dutch but you'll get the idea. By clicking on the payment button the Mobbr payment lightbox appears.

For the Wordpress/Buddypress we need similar functionality. The current lightbox has 4 tabs. tab 2,3 and 4 can stay the same (payments, receivers, related).

In the payment tab there will be a few differences. For now, all payments will be done in bitcoin. The advantage is that the user who pays doesn't need to have a Mobbr account but can just send the btc to the address displayed in the lightbox. Mobbr will then distribute the btc among the Mobbr wallets of the recipient users. The payment tab of the lightbox will include the following elements: title of the task, amount to be paid in dollars, dollar amount converted to bitcoin, url of the task, brief instruction, pay from any bitcoin wallet, pay from mobbr bitcoin wallet, view payment details on Mobbr and payment preview.

Check the milestones and issues for required functionality and open tasks. In the issues the 'webmaster' is defined as the owner/manager of the Wordpress/Buddypress website and the 'user' are the visitors on the webmaster's website. If you have any questions, please let us know in the comment sections of that particular issue. Issues can be found here: https://github.com/mobbr/Mobbr-plugin-buddypress/issues
